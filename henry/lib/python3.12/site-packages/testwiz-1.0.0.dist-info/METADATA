# Unit Test Generator: Enhancing Line and Mutation Coverage

## Overview

This tool generates unit tests to increase both line and mutation coverage, inspired by methodologies from:

- [Automated Unit Test Improvement using Large Language Models at Meta](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09171):  
  - Uses LLMs to identify and fill gaps in test coverage.
- [Effective Test Generation Using Pre-trained Large Language Models and Mutation Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16557):
  - Generates tests that detect and kill code mutants, ensuring robustness.

Features

- Automated Unit Test Generation: Leverages pre-trained LLMs.
- Line Coverage Optimization: Maximizes executed lines during testing.
- Mutation Coverage Enhancement: Generates tests to kill mutants.
- Mutation Testing Integration: Identifies weak spots and improves test robustness.
