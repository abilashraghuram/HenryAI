### Vulnerable Code Areas
**File:** `src/main/java/com/example/BankAccount.java`
1. **Location:** Line 24
   **Description:** The method `getTransactionHistory` returns the original list, allowing external modification.
2. **Location:** Line 60
   **Description:** The method `executeBatchTransactions` does not handle large withdrawals properly, potentially causing runtime exceptions.
3. **Location:** Line 66
   **Description:** The method `scheduleTransaction` allows zero or negative days, which should not be permitted.

### Test Case Gaps
1. **File:** `src/test/java/com/example/BankAccountTest.java`
   **Location:** Test method `testGetTransactionHistory`
   **Reason:** Existing tests do not verify that the returned transaction history is immutable.
2. **File:** `src/test/java/com/example/BankAccountTest.java`
   **Location:** Test method `testExecuteBatchTransactions`
   **Reason:** Tests do not cover scenarios with large withdrawals that could trigger runtime exceptions.
3. **File:** `src/test/java/com/example/BankAccountTest.java`
   **Location:** Test method `testScheduleTransaction`
   **Reason:** Tests do not check for zero or negative days, allowing invalid scheduling.

### Improvement Recommendations
**New Test Cases Needed:**
1. **Test Method:** `testGetTransactionHistoryImmutability`
   - **Description:** Verify that the returned transaction history list cannot be modified externally.
   - **Implementation:** Attempt to modify the list and check that the original list remains unchanged.
2. **Test Method:** `testExecuteBatchTransactionsWithLargeWithdrawals`
   - **Description:** Ensure that the method handles large withdrawals without causing runtime exceptions.
   - **Implementation:** Include a large withdrawal in the batch and verify that the method completes without errors.
3. **Test Method:** `testScheduleTransactionWithZeroOrNegativeDays`
   - **Description:** Ensure that scheduling with zero or negative days throws an exception.
   - **Implementation:** Attempt to schedule a transaction with zero and negative days and verify that an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown.

By addressing these gaps, the test suite will be more robust and capable of catching the identified vulnerabilities, improving the overall code quality and reliability.
